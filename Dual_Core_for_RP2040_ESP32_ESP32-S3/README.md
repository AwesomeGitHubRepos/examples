Examples files for my video "Dual Core Programming for the Raspberry Pi Pico,  ESP32, and ESP32-S3 Using the Arduino IDE": https://youtu.be/w5YigjvSaF4

The RP2040 (found in the Raspberry Pi Pico), the ESP32, and the ESP32-S3 are all dual-core microcontrollers, with two CPU cores. All three can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. Here is a look at how to  program both cores on those chips using the Arduino IDE, including a unified sketch that will work on RP2040 based boards and on ESP32/ESP32-S3 boards.
