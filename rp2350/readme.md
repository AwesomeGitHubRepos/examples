Source code to accompany my video: Raspberry Pi RP2350 vs RP2040 - Performance and Power, including Arm Cortex-M33 vs Hazard RISC-V (https://youtu.be/RrE3bw_HYIU)

This video explores the performance of the Cortex-M0+ in the Raspberry Pi RP2040, the Cortex-M33 in the new RP2350, and the Hazard3 RISC-V in the RP2350. It includes four different benchmarks along with power consumption data!
