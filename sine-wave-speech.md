# Sine-Wave Speech

Here are some notes, links, and resources to accompany my video: TBA

## Notes
Sine-wave speech is synthesized by using a few (typically three or four) time-varying sinusoids that mimic the frequency and amplitude patterns of the resonance peaks of natural speech.

### Formants
A formant is a concentration of acoustic energy around a particular frequency in the speech wave.

Formants are critical for the perception of vowel sounds. Different vowel sounds are distinguished largely by their formant frequencies. 

Sine-wave speech is generated by using a formant tracker to detect the formant frequencies found in an utterance, and then synthesising sine waves that track the centre of these formants.
